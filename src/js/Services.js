                            Aalakuntla Kanakamma(Age:40) from Guravannapet village suicide on 03-01-2013 due to Farming Debts. They have 4 daughters and did not get any support from Government. Adopt-A-Farmer team reviewed & supported her husband Maisaiah for a Buffalo (with 50,000 Rs.), which added them to get monthly standard income. As part of Vegetables garden promotion by AAF, he got the vegetable seeds & moringa tree which also added them some more benefit. With AAF support & his hard work he successfully came out of poverty in 1.5 years, and Now he is able to buy another Buffalo. This makes the Donors as well as Farmer family Happy.
